      <h2>Installing Extras</h2>
      <p>There are certain proprietary drivers (such as nvidia) and packages (such as Google Chrome) that Korora cannot include by default. If you have an nvidia device and wish to use the proprietary drivers then enter following command at a terminal:
      <pre><code>$ sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia</code></pre>
      <p>To install Google Chrome, just use the system's package manager. We can't distribute it, but we have included the repository to make it easy for you to install.</p>
      <p>Looking for Skype? We cannot ship this either and unfortunately we also can't make it easier like Google Chrome as there is no repository. However, just head over to <a ng-click="openURI('http://skype.com')">http://skype.com</a> to download the 32 bit RPM package for Fedora and double it click to install. The package manager will take care of the dependencies for you, even if you're running a 64 bit system.</p>
      <h2>Getting Help</h2>
      <p>Although Korora is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, it's no-where near perfect. There will be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more, or just want to personalise it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!</p>
      <h3>Online Support</h3>
      <p>The Korora Project has created a custom open source support platform for interacting with the community called <a ng-click="openURI('https://kororaproject.org/support/engage')">Engage</a>. Here you can ask a question, post a problem, suggest any ideas you might have, or even leave a little "thanks!" for the team. Simply <a ng-click="openURI('https://kororaproject.org/register/')">register online</a> and join us.
      <h3>Join us on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</h3>
      <p>Another option is to join us on IRC by joining our <em>#korora</em> channel on the <a ng-click="openURI('http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml')">freenode</a> network.
      <h3>Search the Web</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favourite search engine. Just include words like Linux or Fedora in your search query.</p>
      <p>As Korora is a Fedora Remix<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so why not head on over to the official <a ng-click="openURI('http://ask.fedoraproject.org/')">Ask Fedora</a> site? The unofficial <a ng-click="openURI('http://www.forums.fedoraforum.org/')">Fedora Forum</a> is also a great place to go for good community support.</p>
      <p>You can also visit the forums for the desktop you are using with Korora, such as <a ng-click="openURI('http://forums.worldofgnome.org')">GNOME</a>, <a ng-click="openURI('http://forum.xfce.org/')">Xfce</a>, <a ng-click="openURI('http://forums.mate-desktop.org/')">MATE</a>, or <a ng-click="openURI('http://forums.linuxmint.com/')">Cinnamon</a>.</p>
      <h3>Sign up to a mailing list</h3>
      <p>Another way to get help is to email questions to a <a ng-click="openURI('http://lists.fedoraproject.org')">Fedora mailing list</a> (you can also search the history for past discussions). Simply sign up to the list you prefer and follow the instructions. Remember, Korora is a Fedora Remix!</p>
