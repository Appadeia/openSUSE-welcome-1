      <h2>GNOME 3.22</h2>
      <p>Korora 25 includes GNOME 3.22 in its pre-release and in the Final version, coming soon. Helpful new features include multiple file renaming, a redesigned keyboard settings tool, and many other UI improvements across the environment. For full details, refer to the GNOME 3.22 release notes.</p>

      <h2>Cinnamon 3.2</h2>
      <p>Cinnamon 3.2, as the desktop environment ships with support for vertical panels, the ability to play sound effects when displaying notifications, revamped Keyboard applet, a setting for the new menu animations, and improved Xlet settings. Cinnamon 3.2 also comes with workspace switcher improvements, simplified background manager, keyboard navigation for context menus, updated appindicators and settings, support for displaying percentage next to the volume slider, vfade effect by default, as well as hover delay functionality to hot corners.</p>

      <h2>Wayland by default</h2>
      <p>Wayland is the replacement for the legacy X11 display system. Wayland has been under development for several years. While like most software it still has some bugs, we believe itâ€™s ready to serve as a default that works for many users.</p>
      <p>Users can still select the old X11 system if necessary to avoid a problem that affects them.</p>
