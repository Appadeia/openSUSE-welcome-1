          <h2>Installing extras</h2>
          <p>There are certain proprietary drivers (such as nvidia) and packages (such as flash) that Korora cannot ship by default. They are however, available for you to install if you want them.</p>
          <p>To get drivers such as nvidia (for NVIDIA graphics cards) or fglrx (for AMD/ATI graphics cards), use the Jockey device manager. It is available in the applications menu under the name of Additional Drivers.</p>
          <p>Want to install Skype? Then, just head over to http://skype.com to download the package for Fedora and double click to install.</p>
          <h2>Getting help</h2>
          <p>Although Korora is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, it's no-where near perfect. There will be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more or just want to personalise it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!</p>
          <h3>Search the web</h3>
          <p>Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favourite search engine. Just include words like Linux or Fedora in your search query.</p>
          <p>As Korora is a Fedora Remix<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a> why not head on over to the official Ask Fedora site?</p>
          <h3>Look in the forums</h3>
          <p>For specific help with Korora we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!</p>
          <p>As Korora is a Fedora Remix<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the unofficial Fedora Forum is also a great place to go for good community support.</p>
          <p>Korora currently comes with the option of two desktops, both of which have their own user forum too. Depending on your version, visit either that for KDE or GNOME.</p>
          <h3>Join us on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</h3>
          <p>Another option is to join us on IRC by joining our #korora channel on the chat.freenode.net servers.
          <h3>Sign up to a mailing list</h3>
          <p>Another way to get help is to email questions to a Fedora mailing list (you can also search the history for past discussions). Simply sign up to the list you prefer and follow the instructions. There is a list dedicated to KDE as well as a general list for users. Remember, Korora is a Fedora Remix!</p>
