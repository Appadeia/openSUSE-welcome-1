          <h2>Steam</h2>
          <p>The Steam client is now available in the Korora repositories.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We're huge fans of Linux. It's like the indie OS &mdash; a perfect home for our indie game, And who better to lead the charge into Linux gaming than Valve? With Steam distribution on Windows, Mac OS, and now Linux, plus the buy-once, play-anywhere promise of Steam Play, our games are available to everyone, regardless what type of computer they're running. Thatâ€™s huge.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Team Fortress 2, the Free to Play game, is also now available on Steam for Linux. Additional Valve titles available on Steam for Linux include Half-Life, Counter-Strike 1.6, and Counter-Strike: Source.</p>
          <p>In addition to games, the Steam for Linux client includes Big Picture, the new mode of Steam designed for use with a TV and game controller. With Steam for Linux and Big Picture mode, Valve anticipates a growing number of gamers will use Steam in the living room.</p>
